# Bookshop-SQL-Analysis
This project analyzes a bookshop database containing three tables: books, customers, and orders. Using SQL, I explored sales trends, customer behavior, and book performance to generate meaningful business insights.

# Project Overview 
I used the postgreSQL in this project and we are going to explore:
- BASIC QUERIES: stock levels,genres,prices,and orders
- INTERMEDIATE QUERIES: we used joins and aggregations mainly to find the top selling books,most frequent customers and revenue patterns
- INSIGHTS: To understand sales trends and customers behavior

  # HOW TO
  1. Load the bookshop database in PostgreSQL
  2. Run queries from the SQL files
  3. Review insights in " Insights.md "
